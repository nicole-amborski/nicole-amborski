## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the beginning of my coding journey! Thanks CHEM 3PA3....

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on producing a musical for the school's musical theatre club!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code (on a TIGHT schedule...)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email amborskn@mcmaster.ca !!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've played traditionally male roles in both of the musicals I did at this school! (Although I only kept one of them male in my portrayal, gender-swapped the other)
